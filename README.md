### Who?

Physicist, technology development specialist, and science communicator with expertise in science policy and project management, and a background in space science and music.

I have a PhD (dr. rer. nat.) in quantum physics from the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) and I'm working on a (second) MSc thesis in Politics & Technology at the moment.

I'm a T5 geocacher, beetle enthusiast, and I welcome projects on responsible innovation policy.

### What?

Most of my contributions here are in private repositories (recently for [Xanadu](https://xanadu.ai/) and [PennyLane](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/)), but you can see some completed projects on [my website](https://happyturtlethings.net/) or say hi on [fedi](https://mastodon.online/@happyturtlethings).

### Where?

I grew up in Zagreb and spent quite a while in Munich, but I'm now based at the [Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.oist.jp/), where I work on getting cool research from labs out into the world.
